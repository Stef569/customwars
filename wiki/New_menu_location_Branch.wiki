New menu location.

= Introduction =

I have created a new branch for the project so that any developer can check and work on the new menu location and if they get closer to it working. While still haveing a problem they can commit to the branch and put the commit comment as "Done X but am having problems with Y please can someone take a look" and then we don't upset the trunk.


= Details =
The idea of the new menu location branch is to get the menu to pop up where the mouse is clicked instead of in the middle all the time.


= Reasons to have this =
I have found it very annoying to be in one of the corners of the map and then have to move into the middle to click on the menu and then move back to the corner again if there are more units to move. Also AW has it so that the menu comes up where the user clicks.
However, the build menu(s) can still stay in the middle of the game screen as they do in AW.
